            <h1>Picking Example - Firing and Catching "picked" Events</h1>

            <p>This example shows how "picked" events are created within a scene graph when you click on its various
                geometries.</p>

            <p>You can define "picked" listeners on any kind of node so that they will catch those events when they
                occur on Geometry nodes
                within their subgraphs.</p>

            <p>On mouse down, we render the scene in picking mode, passing in the
                mouse canvas coordinates. This will cause a scene render traversal in which
                all the "picked" listeners will fire on those nodes situated above whatever
                geometry node was picked. Each of those node's listeners will be called as their node is
            visited, in the usual depth-first, right-to-left traversal order.</p>
