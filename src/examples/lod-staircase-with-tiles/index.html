                Levels of Detail</h1>

            <p>This scene contains a staircase model that switches representations as a function of the
                projected size of it's extents. The switching is done by a SceneJS.BoundingBox, which selects
                an appropriate model for its cuuernt projected size from among its child nodes. The child nodes
                include SceneJS.Instance nodes that each load a staircase asset from the SceneJS library, each
                with different parameters for number of steps, appearance etc.</p>

            <p>Drag the mouse up and down to move forwards and backwards, left and right to turn.</p>

            <p>Move backwards and watch the staircase simplify.</p>
