            <h1>Cross-Domain Load of a COLLADA House Model from SceneJS.org</h1>

            <p>This is a larger COLLADA model than other examples, loaded cross-domain from SceneJS.org through a proxy
                server. It has 149
                texture images, so it may take some time to load, depending on your connection speed and how busy the
                proxy is right now.</p>

            <p>Model is courtesy of <a
                    href="http://www.vastarchitecture.com/Projects_Residential/Courtyard/Courtyard.html">VaST
                architecture</a>.</p>

            <p>This scene is interactive; to rotate the view, it takes two variables, "yaw" and "pitch", which are
                injected into the scene graph along with "dist" for the distance of the eye on the Z-axis. Take a close
                look
                at the lookAt and rotate nodes, which use these variables, and the invocation of the "render" function
                near
                the bottom of this example, which passes them in.</p>
