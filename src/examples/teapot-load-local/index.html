            <h1>Loading a Subgraph Containing a Teapot Model from the Local File System</h1>

            <p>SceneJS is geared to composition of scenes from re-usable, parameterised fragments. It can automatically
                manage a lean set of in-memory fragments by loading them cross-domain on demand, while evicting them
                following a least-recently-used policy to maintain the pool of free memory. Its terse API means that
                fragments are compact, allowing them to propagate rapidly across the network. Being JavaScript, they
                evaluate straight into the browser with no expensive parsing.</p>

            <p>This example loads an orange teapot from the the local file system.</p>

            <p>When the scene is first rendered, the SceneJS.instance node will perform a GET for the file, which
                will then evaluate into a subgraph of scene content.</p>
