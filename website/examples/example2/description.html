<h1>Example 2 - Procedural Generation</h1>

<p><span>SceneJS provides the <b>generator</b> node to procedurally generate subtrees within your scene graphs.
                     The generator node works by creating a child scope from the result of its configuration function then
                    invoking its child nodes, repeating this process until the config function returns nothing. This example has a generator that creates a half-dozen teapots in a row. It repeatedly creates
                    a child scope containing an X-axis offset, which is used in the configuration of the child <b>translate</b>
                    node, which instances its child <b>teapot</b> node.</span></p>
